# Color_identification-using-OpenCV
Task 2 of my 1 month internship under The Sparks Foundation 


This is a simple project of identifying the various colors in an image,
where ever you will click you will find the color in the left top of the frame 
and the proportion of the red, blue, green colors in that specific color.
This project is done using the OpenCV module to open and read the image
I have used the argparse module to import my image through the terminal using user friendly commands
Pandas library has been used to read my CSV file in which the all the colors and there propertion is mentioned systematically.
